          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          As the title says, my research exists mainly in the niche little intersection of the fields of mathematics, geospatial science, and computer science. What does this actually mean? Usually my projects are in the geospatial science field, however my work on those projects is often heavily focused on computationally applying some rather advanced algebras, or at least some very involved applications of more mundane mathematics. Frequently, this work revolves around navigation and localization, as well as simulations. The navigation and localization is typically done via some application of computer vision/image processing, with most of that application being something akin to odometry. Much of the mathematics I like to delve into in my professional research, as well as in my personal time, relates to vectors, quaternions, dual quaternions, complex quaternions, and projective geometry; at least those are the specific branches I can think of right now as I am writing this!
          <br>
          <br>
          I most frequently work in C and C++, however, when a project requires another language, perhaps due to compatability with other people's code or because an assignment rubric says so, I also use MATLAB, Python, and, reluctantly, R. My most frequented programming library is, without a doubt, <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>. I have, on this site, an ever growing list of my adventures with this library.
          <br>
          <br>
          On a further note about this site, it is essentially a documentation of all my projects which I care to share with the world, as well as some documentation on some really rather niche branches of mathematics. In summary, it is a collection of all the information and tips which I wish I had access to when learning about the various topics I have documented in here.
